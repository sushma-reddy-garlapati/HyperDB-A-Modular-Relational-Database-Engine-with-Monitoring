HyperDB is a modular, high-performance relational database system built from scratch. It features custom file-based storage, buffer management with LRU eviction, tombstone-based slot reuse, page compaction, and real-time monitoring via Prometheus. Designed for backend engineers and systems enthusiasts, HyperDB emphasizes clarity, observability, and production-grade polish.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Buffer Manager** with LRU eviction and page reuse
- 📦 **Page-Level Storage** with tombstone-based slot reuse
- 🔍 **Query Engine** with insert, lookup, and range scan support
- 📊 **Prometheus Monitoring** for page loads and buffer hits
- 🧪 **Benchmark Suite** for insert, lookup, eviction, and reuse
- 📈 **Streamlit Dashboard** for real-time buffer visualization
- 🔁 **Compaction Logic** to reclaim deleted slots
- ⚙️ **CI/CD Integration** with pytest and coverage enforcement
- 🧹 **Modular Design** with clean separation of buffer, storage, and monitoring layers

## 🧪 Benchmark Results

| Operation     | Records | Time (sec) | Avg Latency (μs) |
|---------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| Insert        | 1000    | 0.0008     | 0.8              |
| Lookup        | 1000    | 0.0002     | 0.2              |
| Eviction      | 1000    | 0.0021     | —                |
| Slot Reuse    | 1000    | 0.0036     | 3.6              |

> HyperDB handles thousands of operations in milliseconds, validating buffer logic, offset tracking, and tombstone reuse.
